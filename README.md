# adventureGame

This is a console based adventure game with pokemon-inspired turn based combat that using an object-oriented approach. 

The 'test.json' file contains the local login information of each user that has been created.
The 'item_list.json' file contains all the items in the game along with their stats and purchase costs.
The 'ability_list.json' file contains all the abilities in the game seperated by the classes I created.

I created this project in order to improve my proficieny in the fundamentals of python and object oriented programming in a fun way.
